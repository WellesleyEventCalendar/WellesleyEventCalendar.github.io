    <h1>Guide to Creating Your Own Events</h1>
    
    <p>What follows is a note/letter/advice thing I wrote for people creating their own events (i.e. submitting events to the calendar as an individual, not an org) because I am SO EXCITED for people to host and want to be as supportive as I can be.  That said, you absolutely do not need to read this if you don’t want to — you can also just <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVJ8QkUMwW-gm_gBYUZ1jN8rF28VvW3dVW5XSCpBEdyZlIIQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">fill out the form now</a> to host your own events.  Happy hosting :)</p>
    
    <p>Now for the letter:</p>
    
    <p>So, you want to host your own event.  First of all, WOOOHOOOO! That’s awesome!  Thanks for taking the initiative to make more events open to students at Wellesley.</p>
    
    <p>I wanted to include a page on this site with tips for hosting your own events because for me, that’s how this calendar project started: some friends and I wanted there to be more things going on, so we started hosting movie nights and board game nights.  Part of my vision for this website was to create a place where others could do the same thing on a bigger scale.  Thanks for wanting to be part of that community!</p>
    
    <p>From hosting those events with my friends, I did learn a few things that I want to share in the hopes that I can help you host great events.  Obviously, you don’t have to follow them, but I want them to be available for anyone who’s interested.  So, here’s what I’ve got:</p>
    
    <h3>Picking when to have your event</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Ask around!  Find out when people would want to come! </li>
        <li>Use the calendar to figure out when might work best around other events</li>
        <li>I have a theory that there aren’t many events happening on weekends not because no one is on campus but because people think no one is on campus, so people tend not to schedule events for weekends.  Screw that, I say!  Don’t be afraid to host things on weekends!</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Getting people to come to your event</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you’re worried about no one coming, first thing to keep in mind is that most events will be a success regardless of how many people show up.  I mean it.  One of the best games of capture the flag my friends and I hosted had 6 people attend when we had planned on having 60.  And it was great.</li>
        <li>Text people you know who you think might be interested.  Also text friends even if they might not be interested.  Whatever you do, beware the group chat!  I would super super discourage you from pubbing your events in group chats because the accountability is SO much higher if you message those people individually</li>
        <li>Remind people to come!  Re-text everyone you already texted the day of or the day before (or both) reminding them that your event is happening.  As great as google calendar and facebook events are, the accountability is again SO much higher coming from you</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Picking a location</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Common rooms!  I cannot stress this enough: common rooms are for us to use to do fun stuff.  Yes, you do need to be respectful of people doing work in them, but a lot of the time you can find a common rooms to have your event in (assuming you're following quiet hours/other dorm policy).  I would recommend talking to your HP or RA about it if you have questions.</li>
        <li>If you do host an event in a common room, I would go into the common room about half an hour before your event and just tell everyone there what's going to happen, invite them to it, and be super nice, respectful, and understanding about it.</li>
        <li>If the common rooms just aren't cutting it, here's a list of other places I believe you can host events without having to reserve the space (but I could be wrong!  Definitely check before hosting): <h3>(can people in beta testing double check this list and suggest locations to add?? thank you!!!)</h3>: outside somewhere!, your room/your friends' rooms, Bates dining hall after hours, Caz and pom basements</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Getting event ideas</h3>
    
    <p>This is less of a tip and more of a list of potential events for inspiration if you’re looking for something to create (this also happens to be a list of cool events I want to have happen at Wellesley and would love for someone to host ;) )</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Board game night, movie night, picnics, a random day where everyone shows up to the dining halls in super fancy dinner clothes, campus-wide manhunt, tea parties, excursion to Morses pond, 3am cookie baking,  workshops led by students about random stuff they know about (minecraft modding! Crocheting! songwriting! cool etymology! fun stuff!)</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Important note!!</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Educate yourself on campus policies relevant to your event.  Because you are hosting the event, it’s your responsibility to make sure everything you do follows relevant campus policy.  The responsibility for you or your event breaking any legal or campus policy is yours and yours alone.  This calendar and I absolutely do not condone events breaking any legal or campus policy.</li>
    </ul>
        
    <p>Finally, I encourage you to just do it.  I know that hosting events can be scary and stressful and seem like it’s not worth it, but if you want something to happen the only way to guarantee it happens is by doing it yourself (or coercing your friends into hosting it for you).  Chances are it’ll go well, and if it doesn’t it is actually not a big deal.  For real.  This is the frickin Wellesley community we’re talking about.  We’ve got your back.</p>
    
    <p>I hope this rambling stream of advice was helpful to you in one way or another.  Now, I encourage you to go and create awesome, kickass, inspiring events!  What’s more, go find other peoples’ events and show up for them!  If you want any help or have more questions, feel free to email me at ____.  Otherwise, good luck, and maybe I’ll see you there!</p>
