    <br><br>
    <p style="
    text-align:center; font-size: 1.18em;">
        This website was created by Wellesley students for Wellesley students.  It's an unofficial, centralized location to find and post events happening on campus.  This calendar relies on your input and participation, so please feel free to add events to the calendar and use the calendar to find events!</p>

     FAQ's
    </h1>
    <br><br>
    <div class="letterColumn">
        <h3>
    How can I filter the events in the calendar?
    </h3>
    <p>
    At the top right of the calendar (right next to where it says Week Month Agenda), there's an arrow.  Click on the arrow, and you'll be able to choose which types of events you want to view.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
    How can I import events into my own calendar?
    </h3>
    <p>
    Click on the event and choose copy to my calendar!  Note that if an event's details get edited after you import it, the event on your calendar will not be updated.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
    Why can't I see any events?
    </h3>
    <p>
    If you can see a calendar but there are no events on it, make sure you're logged into your Wellesley email address in your browser.  The calendar's permissions are limited to people with Wellesley email addresses, so it likely is blocking you from seeing the events because you're not signed in.
    </p>
    <br>
        <h3>
    What are the criteria for an event to be added to the calendar?
    </h3>
    <p>
    Every event added to this calendar should be open to all Wellesley students, and cannot break any campus policy or law.  Other than that, feel free to be creative in making your events!
    </p>
    <br>
        
           <h3>
    I have an idea for how to improve this calendar!
    </h3>
    <p>
    Have an idea for how this website can better serve the Wellesley community?  Let us know <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiKHTa_sWdkQ-PnGN9Ilajdv0CrT2MO6EydZ0dvjqQxCvSVg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">here</a>!
    </p>
    <br>
    
    
        </div>
    
    <div class="letterColumn">
        <h3>
    How quickly do events I submit get added to the calendar?
    </h3>
    
    <p>Immediately!  There's some fancy backend code happening so that when you press submit on the event submission forms, the event automatically gets added to the calendar.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>
    Who can add events to the calendar?
    </h3>

    <p>Any Wellesley student!  If you are submitting an event on behalf of an org, you can use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftILu_PojuEOXtvfhqXRgMc-QVO3gcu7eTz88h7WiQjdb9ig/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">form to add org events</a>.  If you're an individual student who just wants to host a fun event, you can use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVJ8QkUMwW-gm_gBYUZ1jN8rF28VvW3dVW5XSCpBEdyZlIIQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">form to add your own event</a>.  If you submit an event through the org form, your org is responsible for the event, whereas if you submit an event as an individual, you are responsible and liable for the event.</p>
    <br>
    
        <h3>
    Why isn't my event showing up on the calendar?
    </h3>
        <p>  First, try reloading the page.  If that doesn't work and it's been a couple minutes since you submitted the form, there was probably an error when Google tried to create an event based on what you put in the form.  Try resubmitting the form and double-checking that everything is filled in and formatted properly.  If it still isn't working, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiKHTa_sWdkQ-PnGN9Ilajdv0CrT2MO6EydZ0dvjqQxCvSVg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">fill out the feedback form</a> with your event's details and we'll put it up for you.</p>
        
        <br>
    <h3>
    How can I edit an event I already submitted?
    </h3>
    <p>If you need to edit an event, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiKHTa_sWdkQ-PnGN9Ilajdv0CrT2MO6EydZ0dvjqQxCvSVg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">fill out the feedback form</a> with the changes you need made and we'll take care of it. </p>
