    <h1>About This Website</h1>
    <h3>If anyone wants a boring ole blurb about this site here it is:</h3>
    
    <p>This website was created by Ellie Czepiel ’20 in the summer of 2018 to be a centralized location in which Wellesley students could find and post events happening on campus.  Students can view the calendar, sort by event type, and import individual events or the entire calendar to their own Google calendars.  In addition, students can submit events to add to the calendar, either on behalf of orgs or as individuals who want to host events open to the whole school.</p>
    
    <h3>Now for the fun stuff.  Here’s the actual origin story of this website:</h3>
    
    <p>My sophomore fall, I suddenly got bored with everything happening on campus.  I went through most of first semester working my ass off and not having much fun.  It was super dissatisfying.</p>
    
    <p>That February, I was talking to a new friend about how boring and lonely I felt Wellesley was.  She understood, but had a much more optimistic view.  She listed all the things she loved at Wellesley, which wasn't even something it had occurred to me to do.  We started planning hosting events together as a way to make Wellesley better for ourselves and our friends.</p>
    
    <p>We hosted a couple of board game nights that were huge successes.  People met people they didn’t know, had a ton of fun, and were interested in the events continuing. (shoutout to all those people -- you're the best!!)</p>
    
    <p>Throughout the rest of the semester, our repertoire of events expanded to include movie nights, dungeon and dragons character building workshops, and capture the flag nights.  Sophomore spring felt like a huge success and, quite honestly, hosting events people liked felt great.</p>
    
    <p>This brings me to the creation of this website summer after my sophomore year.  I want to give people a platform to be able to do what my friends and I did last semester on a bigger scale.  I know that collectively the Wellesley community has an insane supply of creativity and drive, so I wanted to put this platform out there and see what we can do with it.</p>
    
    <p>There’s also another reason behind the creation of this website.  I have a theory, which was partially confirmed by a survey I sent out in May 2018, that there is actually a lot happening on campus, people just perceive there to not be much because there’s no good way to find all the events happening in a given timeframe.  Part of the idea in making this website was also to take a stab at solving that problem.</p>
    
    <p>My hope for this calendar is that you find it helpful, user-friendly, and worth your time.  My hope is also, and perhaps more importantly so, that you will feel comfortable <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftILu_PojuEOXtvfhqXRgMc-QVO3gcu7eTz88h7WiQjdb9ig/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">adding existing org events</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVJ8QkUMwW-gm_gBYUZ1jN8rF28VvW3dVW5XSCpBEdyZlIIQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">hosting your own events</a> and, most importantly, that you will feel comfortable letting me know if you’re facing any obstacles or roadblocks, both in using the website to find events and in posting new ones.  This website is for you, so if it could be working better, please let me know what I can do.  You can email me at ____.  </p>
    
    <p>Otherwise, happy eventing!</p>
